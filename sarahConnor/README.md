Bye Radek!

It was a pleasure working with you and I'm so glad you let me do so! In the short time that we've worked together, I've already learned so much and you've given me the drive to not be lazy and to try to be a better programmer every day.

You're going to do amazing at Hashicorp and be surrounded by super intelligent people who can teach you a thing or two.

Best of luck and so long for now!
