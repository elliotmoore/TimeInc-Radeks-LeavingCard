# Farewell but not Goodbye

Radek, whilst we only knew each other for a brief period I must say that I'm pleased to have spent that time with you.

You're a unique individual with the knowledge and passion to conquer all endeavour you set out for yourself.

I look forward to our paths crossing in the near future.

Best regards,

Jared
