### GoodBye Mr Simko, Mr Goat..
Farewell (@radeksimko) you will be missed.
From all alone in Python Pipe to globally known Terraform Twister you have done us proud.
Sad to see you go, but happy that you go to a place like Hashicorp to work on a project you have put much effort into.
OpenSource is close to your heart and we wish you all the best in the future.


### Background
Joining in 2013 he was hired to bring order to `PIPE`, the Python importer, processor and exporter, responsible for running Internationl Property classifieds feeds for Country Life.

After stablizing that platform, in which he put in many puppet PR's to create a test environment, we noticed that he had a avid interest and skills in Infrastructure, so we were happy when he jumped ship from the dev to the ops team and worked on platform engineering for us. 

Ducking bullets from Corp InfoSec and IT, Radek also helped out the US/Seattle teams with Release Tooling, creating what we boringly call (because we could not find a suitable name) `rt` - enabled SI.com to 'DevOps' themselves to managing thier own platform and docker deploys.

### Quirks and Radekisms 
Oh yeah! Radek hates it when you have a DevOps team or a DevOps person or use buzzwords in the wrong place. So we are synergizing by DevOpsing his leaving card on GitHub

He loves his emojis and his memes always seeing to pick the right one in slack in response to news or your message :troll:  

And this repo will have a few of the things we have noticed he likes and dislikes! ;-) 

Just need to force push this message

### Your Team
From ending up being the sole developer on Pipe to joining the central Ops team, [Who is radek?!] he suddenly had people to bounce ideas off, and being in ops put him in more contact with the other devs. 
As his AWS expertise grew and his tooling became more known, he started to mentor other people in the department and became well loved and respected and a team player and an encouraging person.

Talking up on Brew/Cask, Python, Puppet, Terraform, Go and Git best practices.

At Time Inc, Radek has grown to be a stronger, collaborative and fun to be with team player who even on his last day helped us all out! 

Good Luck mate ;-D
