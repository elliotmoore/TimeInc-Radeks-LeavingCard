Au revior, aufeidersehn, goodbye, and most of all, THANK YOU Radek Simko!

I really appreciate all the help and advice you've given me over the past six months. I've really enjoyed getting to know you and I very much hope that we'll stay in touch.

Thank you for putting up with endless questions and fundamental misunderstandings, and for widening my viewpoint of best practice, availability and scale! I have no doubt you're going on to do some truly great things.

Best of luck in all your future endeavours!

Lots of love, from Paul
